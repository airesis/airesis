          <p>
          A quorum is the parameter that determines when the debate of the proposal ends and the voting phase starts.<br />
          When you create a new proposal you choose one of the quorum available in the Open Space or one among the quorums available in your group.<br />
          In this window you can click the different quorums in order to view its characteristics: you will find the description and the list of the parameters chosen.<br />
