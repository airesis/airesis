          You can suggest if the text of the proposal is complete or not using the two buttons below the bar.<br />
          The editor of the proposal has to write the text on the basis of the contributions of other participants. When the text of the proposal changes you will be given the possibility to suggest if you like or not the new text and, as a consequence, to modify your previous evaluation.<br />
          The color of the bar shows if the proposal is ready to go to the voting phase, while the length shows how much time and/or evaluations are left before the discussion ends.<br />

          <h3>What is a quorum?</h3>
          A quorum is the parameter that determines when the debate of the proposal ends and the voting phase starts.<br />
          When you create a new proposal you choose one of the quorum available in the Open Space or one among the quorums available in your group.<br />
